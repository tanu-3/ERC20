# Vibranium Exchange using ERC20

This fullstack project aims for the demo of token miniting, transfer and burning in ERC20.

## Description
The smart contract can be deployed on any test net or hardhat, This contract is an ERC20 contract. ```customer[] public customers``` is an array to store the buyers in a queue. A buyer can addup into queue by calling ```requestTokens()```. Multiple buyers will be added in queue. Then then contract owner will call ```mintToken()```that can only be called by owner which will mint tokens for all the buyers in the queue and make it empty. ```burnToken()``` will burn the token and ```transferToken()``` will transfer the token to other address.
```getBuyerBalance()``` is used to check the active queue list.
